<p>It’s important to approach design courses through a lens of questioning. Asking the simple question “what is a website” helps you to better approach the fact that a website doesn’t exist in any particular way and can exist through any means you see it to. Obviously it’s also a collective of numbers and files, but it can also be used as a source of communication.  I loved all the analogies of what a website can be; a room, a shelf, a plant. I would think of a website like an ecosphere, which is a sealed off self-sufficient ecosystem that only depends on the “sources” of nutrients around it, I feel like websites function in a similar way and how they’re hosted on a server with specific files and assets. I like the idea that we all use technology and may see specific things as “lower” forms of technology, but all technology requires a certain amount of skill. I can use a lighter more easily than creating a fire with sticks and rocks, but the lighter is more “advanced” just easier to operate.

<p> This reading explored the idea of websites being organic almost natural creations, I like the idea of the internet being its own ecosystem somewhat out of our control! Websites don’t last forever, if they’re not hosted permanently they’ll be lost to time, which is kinda crazy, so they are very organic in a way, always ebbing and flowing. They will grow and change, you’ll remember old versions of websites and posts that will forever be lost to time, which is wild.

<p> Learning about the way that percentages operate when it comes to coding was really interesting, if I'm being honest I still don't think I fully understand them, at least not yet but that's okay. Being able to use the tool to actually see how the percentages make certain things change, such as width and be ing able to visually see that was super helpful!

<p> The reading of this week, a friend is writing, was incredibly interesting, i've never seen a piece of writing be approached in this way, as if multiple chats with unknown strangers, who could also in a way be close friends pop up to "Chat" with you to reveal the narrative of the writing. The way the site was organized was incredibly intriguing and just drew me in. It really made me think about how web design can be used as a narrative tool in a way that just text on a paper cannot. Each medium has their benefits and their unique strategies for their use.

<p> This week I decided to explore Damon Zucconi’s piece, Debt. As someone who constantly mispells things and types things incorrectly I often think about how texting has created a new "language" especially based on the idea of fat fingering which is explored in the piece, constantly hitting the keys around the letters your using for what you're actually trying to spell. Looking at the model and how it operated was funny because the level of grammatical errors seemed almost laughable, but it felt real at the same time knowing that I've made so many of the same mistakes in the past, but are they even really mistakes? I think at this point they've just become apart of the language. We just accept that we may have typed something wrong and send is speedily as if we're have a real timed mispellen conversation. </p>

<p> The internet is an amazing tool to use in the modern age when it comes to social awareness. In a way it's something that's actively "destroying" the land, but at the same time it's also informing us of ecological misdeeds that we wouldn't even know about if not for global communication. If the internet can be a viewed as a place, does that mean it has laws? Who are we governed by, social media companies? But their censorship is never true censorship because people will always find a way around it and speak their own truth. It's run by many corporations, but at the same time it can never be truly controlled.

<p> I have always found myself existing in online spaces, when I was younger I would peruse minecraft and had so many self acclaimed "friends" people I had never even seen before. I think online spaces are extremely important for fostering relationships with people you would have never even talked to if not for the internet. I think it's important to be intentional with making these spaces because sometimes they turn into a whole different beast that can become dangerous on the internet and in the outside world, for example 4chan or reddit, it can really pass into the real world in negative ways. Tiktok can help foster negative and positive enviroments, but keep people connected peole will have hobbies that feel so small and insigificant but suddenly they'll find tons of other people who also love the thing they love!
